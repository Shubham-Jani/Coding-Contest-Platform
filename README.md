## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Coding-Competition-Platform" is an open-source Django project designed for hosting coding competitions and contests. It's easy to set up using Docker, making it suitable for educational institutions and coding clubs. The platform supports custom problem creation and competition rounds, and future plans include test case support.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin using "Coding-Competition-Platform," make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Linux Operating System:** This platform is designed to work best on Linux-based systems.

2. **Docker:** You'll need Docker installed on your system to efficiently manage containers. If you don't have Docker installed, you can find installation instructions for various Linux distributions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

3. **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing multi-container Docker applications. Make sure you have Docker Compose installed; installation details can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you'll be ready to set up and run "Coding-Competition-Platform" with ease.
